We believe in the <span class="tag-cloud">simplicity</span> and <span class="tag-cloud">elegance</span> of <span class="tag-cloud">software well designed</span>:

<ul class="check"> 
    <li>Simple</li>
    <li>To the point</li>
    <li>Easy to understand</li>
</ul>

<span class="tag-cloud">ZenWave Code Generator</span> is part of suite of tools to help you create software easy to understand.

## Not (just) a Code Generator

ZenWave Code Generator is not a Code Generator but a <span class="tag-cloud">Modeling Tool</span> for Domain Driven Design and API-First in disguise of a _code generator_.

Its purpose is to produce successful software projects by <span class="tag-cloud">dramatically shortening the feedback loop</span> between the expert domain knowledge and working software and its tests.

![Domain Driven Design Feedback Loop](https://zenwave360.github.io/zenwave-code-generator/docs/ZenWave-360-DDD-Feedback-Loop-with-ZW-Products.excalidraw.svg)

In this way all team members: **Domain Experts**, **Product Owners**, **Software Archytechts**, **Developers** and **Testers** can provide early feedback based on an **Ubiquitous Language (JDL/ZDL)** and the software and tests generated from that model.

## How

### Leveraging <span class="tag-cloud">DDD</span>

- Adopting [JHipster Domain Language (JDL)](https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/intro) to let you define your domain model: entities, relationships, agregates, input models, search criterias...
- Providing ZenWave Domain Language (<span class="tag-cloud">ZDL</span>) ([comming soon](https://github.com/ZenWave360/zenwave-code-generator/blob/main/zenwave-code-generator-test-resources/src/main/resources/io/zenwave360/generator/resources/jdl/orders-model-eda-idl.jdl)) to let you connect your business model to Event-Driven Architecture, much more than an AsyncAPI IDL..

### Leveraging <span class="tag-cloud">API-First</span>

- Generating (draft) API Definition Documents (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI and GraphQL) from your DDD models, saving a lot of time
- Generating Functional Code from API Definitions (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI and GraphQL)
- (AsyncAPI) Implementing API-First Producers, Consumers and Enterprise Integration Patterns from AsyncAPI Definitions for your Event-Driven Microservices

### <span class="tag-cloud">Tests as First-Class</span> citizien

- Generating (lots of) Tests from API First Definitions
- Generating Validated Mocks (Consumer Contracts) from API First Definitions

## What

- Extensible CLI with an evergrowing set of [standard generator-plugins](ZenWave-Code-Generator/CLI#list-of-available-plugins)
- [Maven Plugin](ZenWave-Code-Generator/Maven-Plugin) so you can execute any standard or custom generator-plugin as part of your build process
- IDE Model Editor (comming soon): text-based model editor that lets you visualize and work with your Models and APIs in different ways so your software _fits in your own head_
