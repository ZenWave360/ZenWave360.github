## Domain Driven Design with ZenWave 360ยบ

> "There are three types of developers implementing microservices. <br/> Those who use DDD, those who don't realise they do, and those who fail."

- Using JDL/ZDL as **Ubiquitous Language** for **Data on the Inside** and 

- **API-First** specs like **AsyncAPI** and **OpenAPI** to describe Inter Process Communications (IPC) for **Data on the Outside**.

## Domain Driven Design

**DDD:** is about building software around a domain model that represents the problem we want to solve. Expressed by and Ubiquitous Language that is shared by all team members. It helps understand the problem before thinking of a solution. It connects Domain Experts with Technical Experts building a shared understanding of the problem and the solution.

**ZenWave360:** is about speeding up the feedback loop from idea -> model -> working software and tests.

## Not (just) a Code Generator

ZenWave SDK is a **Modeling Tool** for Domain Driven Design and API-First in disguise of a _code generator_.

Its purpose is to produce successful software projects by dramatically shortening the feedback loop between the expert domain knowledge and working software and its tests.

</p>

In this way all team members: **Domain Experts**, **Product Owners**, **Software Architects**, **Developers** and **Testers** can provide early feedback based on an **Ubiquitous Language (JDL)** and the software and tests generated from that model.
