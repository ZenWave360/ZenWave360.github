## Event Storming

Collaborative Workshop Technique: Event Storming is a collaborative workshop technique used to explore complex business domains.

Shared Understanding: Its primary goal is to create a shared understanding among stakeholders, including business experts and technical teams.

Visualization: Event Storming involves visually mapping out the flow of events and their interactions in a domain. This helps in making complex processes more tangible.

Sticky Notes and Markers: The technique typically uses sticky notes and markers to represent events, commands, and other domain elements. This provides a hands-on, interactive way to work through the domain.

Focus on Events: Events play a central role in Event Storming. They represent significant occurrences in the domain that trigger changes or reactions.

Temporal Order: Events are arranged in a temporal order, helping to understand the sequence of actions and reactions in the system.

Aggregates and Entities: Event Storming helps in identifying aggregates and entities within the domain. Aggregates are clusters of related objects that are treated as a single unit.

Commands and Policies: Alongside events, commands and policies are also used to represent actions and rules within the domain.

Discovery and Exploration: Event Storming is an exploratory process. It encourages participants to ask questions, clarify concepts, and uncover hidden complexities.

Ubiquitous Language: It promotes the use of a shared, domain-specific language (Ubiquitous Language) that is understood by all stakeholders. This helps in bridging the gap between business experts and technical teams.

Iterative Process: Event Storming is often an iterative process. As understanding deepens, the model evolves to reflect new insights and knowledge.

Focus on Business Value: It helps in identifying areas of high business value, enabling teams to prioritize development efforts effectively.

Avoidance of Analysis Paralysis: Event Storming encourages a pragmatic approach, avoiding over-analysis and emphasizing meaningful conversations and actions.

Continuous Learning and Improvement: It fosters a mindset of continuous learning and improvement, enabling teams to adapt to changing domain requirements.

Facilitation Skills: Effective facilitation is crucial for a successful Event Storming session. A skilled facilitator guides the discussion, encourages participation, and ensures productive outcomes.
