    The critical complexity of most software projects is in understanding the domain itself.

    The heart of software is its ability to solve domain-related problems for its users. The best software supports elegant solutions to real-world problems

"Design, in the DDD sense, is really about understanding, not inventing."

"The most effective way to model is to do so in the context of a running system that can demonstrate whether the model actually works."

"Code is not the center, but merely one expression of the model."

"The domain model is a powerful communication tool. It provides a shared vision of the structure and behavior of the system."

## Domain Driven Design and API-First for Event Driven Microservices

## Not (just) a Code Generator

ZenWave SDK is a **Modeling Tool** for Domain Driven Design and API-First in disguise of a _code generator_.

Its purpose is to produce successful software projects by dramatically shortening the feedback loop between the expert domain knowledge and working software and its tests.

In this way all team members: **Domain Experts**, **Product Owners**, **Software Architects**, **Developers** and **Testers** can provide early feedback based on an **Ubiquitous Language (JDL)** and the software and tests generated from that model.

## Why Domain Driven Design?

> "There are three types of developers implementing microservices. Those who use DDD, those who don't realise they do, and those who fail."

**DDD:** is about building software around a domain model that represents the problem we want to solve. Expressed by and Ubiquitous Language that is shared by all team members. It helps understand the problem before thinking of a solution. It connects Domain Experts with Technical Experts building a shared understanding of the problem and the solution.

**ZenWave360:** is about speeding up the feedback loop from idea -> model -> working software and tests.
