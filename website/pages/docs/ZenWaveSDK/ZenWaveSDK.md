# ZenWave SDK

> üëâ ZenWave360 Helps You Create Software that's Easy to Understand


ZenWave SDK is a configurable and extensible code generator tool for **Domain Driven Design** and **API-First** for **Event Driven Microservices** that can generate code from a mix of different models including:

- [JHipster Domain Language JDL](Domain-Driven-Design/JDL-Domain-Language) to describe your domain model: entities, aggregated and relations.
- [ZenWave Domain Language ZDL](Domain-Driven-Design/ZDL-Domain-Language) for Event-Driven Microservices beyond CRUD applications.
- [AsyncAPI](API-First/OpenAPI)
- [OpenAPI](API-First/AsyncAPI)

Using JHipster Domain Language/ZenWave Domain Language as **Ubiquitous Language** for **Data on the Inside** and **API-First** specs like **AsyncAPI** and **OpenAPI** to describe Inter Process Communications (IPC) for **Data on the Outside**.

- **JHipster Domain Language/ZenWave Domain Language as Ubiquitous Language:** To describe your domain core domain model and its relations, operations and events.
- **API-First specs like AsyncAPI and OpenAPI:** To describe Inter Process Communications (IPC) between bounded contexts/microservices.

## Generate complete Event Driven Microservices using DDD and API-First

You can generate complete Event Driven Microservices using DDD and API-First

> üëâ Describe your Model ‚Üí Generate Backend ‚§≥ Generate OpenAPI ‚§≥ Generate AsyncAPI ‚Üí Generate API Implementations ‚Üí Generate Tests and Contracts üëç

1. Start by describing your core domain model using JDL entities and relationships, annotations and comments.
2. Generate a complete Backend Application from your Domain Definition Model.
3. Generate a draft OpenAPI definition from the JDL model. Edit collaboratively this OpenAPI document and then generate some more functional code and tests from that definition.
4. Generate a draft AsyncAPI definition for consuming async request commands and publishing domain events. Now use zenwave maven plugin to generate strongly typed business interfaces implementing some Enterprise Integration Patterns like: transactional outbox, business dead letter queue...
5. Generate E2E, Integration tests and Consumer Contracts for the public APIs you just produced.
