## Modeling Data on the Inside and Data on the Outside

<Image alt="ZenWave SDK Modeling Languages" light={modelingLanguagesLight} dark={modelingLanguagesDark} />

Based on **Domain Driven Design (DDD)** and **API-First** for **Event Driven Microservices**.

ZenWave SDK is a configurable and extensible tool for **Domain Driven Design (DDD)** and **API-First** for **Event Driven Microservices** that can generate code from a mix of different models including:

- [ZenWave Domain Language (ZDL)]() as **Ubiquitous Language** you can model the output of an Event-Storming.
- [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/getting-started/coming-from-openapi): Industry de-facto standard to describe Event-Driven Architectures for Message-based APIs.
- [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/): Industry standard for Request-Response Architectures with REST APIs.

Using ZenWave Domain Language as **Ubiquitous Language** for modeling and describing Bounded Contexts: aggregates, entities with their relationships, services, value objects, commands and events.

ZenWave Domain Language can be considered as an *extended subset* of [JHipster Domain Language (JDL)](https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/intro) that let's you describe your entities and relationships.

Using ZenWave Domain Language as **Ubiquitous Language** for **Data on the Inside** and **API-First** specs like **AsyncAPI** and **OpenAPI** to describe Inter Process Communications (IPC) for **Data on the Outside**.


- **ZenWave Domain Language (ZDL) as Ubiquitous Language:** To describe your domain core domain model.
- **API-First specs like AsyncAPI and OpenAPI:** to describe Inter Process Communications (IPC) between bounded contexts/microservices.
- **ZenWave SDK:** to generate (_a lot of_) infrastructure, functional and testing code from your models and APIs.

ZenWave SDK is designed to be easily extensible and adaptable to your project or your organization needs and likes. You can always [fork an existing, standard or custom plugin](https://github.com/ZenWave360/zenwave-sdk/#forking-an-standard-or-custom-plugin).

## ZenWave SDK Installation

You can install the latest release using [jbang](https://www.jbang.dev) running the following command:

```shell
jbang alias add --fresh --name=zw release@zenwave360/zenwave-sdk
```

Please refer to [**ZenWave SDK**](https://github.com/ZenWave360/zenwave-sdk/) for more detailed installation options.

## ZenWave SDK Generated Code

You can generate complete Event Driven Microservices using DDD and API-First

> üëâ Describe your Model ‚Üí Generate Backend ‚§≥ Generate OpenAPI ‚§≥ Generate AsyncAPI ‚Üí Generate API Implementations ‚Üí Generate Tests and Contracts üëç

1. Start by describing your core domain model using JDL entities and relationships, annotations and comments.
2. Generate a complete Backend Application from your Domain Definition Model.
3. Generate a draft OpenAPI definition from the JDL model. Edit collaboratively this OpenAPI document and then generate some more functional code and tests from that definition.
4. Generate a draft AsyncAPI definition for consuming async request commands and publishing domain events. Now use zenwave maven plugin to generate strongly typed business interfaces implementing some Enterprise Integration Patterns like: transactional outbox, business dead letter queue...
5. Generate E2E, Integration tests and Consumer Contracts for the public APIs you just produced.
