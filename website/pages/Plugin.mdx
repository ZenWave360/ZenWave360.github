Editing support for the ZDL Domain Model Language:

- Running ZenWave SDK plugins right from the editor (requires _cli_ installed)
- Markdown preview with PlantUML diagrams (requires PlantUML plugin installed)
- Syntax highlighting
- Linting and errors

Work in progress:
- Code Completion and Formatting for ZDL syntax
- Code Completion for available SDK plugins and options, including your custom plugins
- Code Navigation (Ctrl+Click) from ZDL model to source code and API definitions

# ZenWave Editor for VSCode

ZenWave Editor provides Syntax Highlighting for ZDL on VSCode.

It is available on the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ZenWave360.zdl-vscode).

It also works 'on the web', for example on the `github.dev` user interface reached by pressing `.` (the period key) when browsing a repository or Pull Request in GitHub.
